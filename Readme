(Capstone Masters Project) Image Matching utilizing fast 1-D 256-point discrete cosine transform (DCT) running at 100MHz. The 256-point DCT has 16 layers with 128 operations each. Images are processed through the Verilog device in 1-D, transposed using a Python script, and processed through the Verilog device again as 2-D. The result is a correlation between two images via Python.


Running order:
	
	-> grayscale.py
	-> dct256.v
	-> transpose.py
	-> dct256.v
	-> correlation.py

Verilog code:
	dct256.v		a fast 1-D 256-point DCT, the top Verilog module
	bfly.v			a cosine list used for butterfly's twiddle factor, the sub Verilog module
	dct256_tb.v		a testbench for dct256.v

Python code:
	correlation.py		a correlation for ten photos
	dct16.py		a fast 1-D 16-point DCT, not used in this project
